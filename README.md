# Dimensionality Reduction with Increasingly Fine Covers

This folder contains the greedy algorithm that I have developed in order to generate lower-dimensional increasingly-fine
covers of a high-dimensional manifold while maintaining its general structure. The Matlab code and my poster that I used to present my research to the faculty of DePaul at the DePaulâ€™s Research Showcase event in November 2017 can be found in this folder. You can also find the covers that my algorithm creates.
